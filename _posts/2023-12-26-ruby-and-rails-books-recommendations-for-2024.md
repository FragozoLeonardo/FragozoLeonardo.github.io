### Hello! With this present post I will show you here that Ruby (And Rails) is far from dead, actually there is a lot of books (if you are a book person, as developer, I believe in you can benefit a lot from books), if you are not an English language native speaker you can always make a effort and "shot two birds with one stone", learning code and English as well? ready? here we go!, please bear in mind that it's my bucket list for 2024.

### Ruby:

### Programming Ruby 3.3 by Noel Rappin, with Dave Thomas:

### The classic "pickaxe" book has been updated for Ruby 3, and while there is value in learning older versions due to the prevalence of legacy codebases, starting with the latest version is often more beneficial for learning.

### You can purchase the book [here](https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby5/programming-ruby-3-3-5th-edition/) (as of late dec/23 it's on beta), but you'll receive the full book when the final version is released.

### Ruby On Rails:

### The Rails 7 Way by Lucas Dohmen, Tom Henrik Aadland, and Obie Fernandez:

### This extensive book, both in size and quality, should be considered the bible for Rails developers. It covers everything from model creation to security, including defenses against attacks like SQL injections. Purchase it [here](https://leanpub.com/therails7way).

### Ruby On Rails - Frontend:

### Modern Front-End Development for Rails - Second Edition - Hotwire, Stimulus, Turbo and React by Noel Rappin:

### Even though it's from 2022, the content remains cutting-edge for many developers and companies. Incorporating Hotwire into your Rails projects is an excellent way to demonstrate that you are up-to-date with the latest features. You can purchase the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Front-End-Development-Rails-Stimulus/dp/1680509616/)

### Tests (Specs) 

### Hands-on Test-Driven Development: Using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and RSpec by Greg Donald:

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+96Svt0CL._SL1180_.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:30%;">

### Tests, whether you love them or not, are a cornerstone of our Rails developer community. They are often required even for junior/entry-level positions, making it essential to know how to write them. You can purcharse [here](https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Test-Driven-Development-Using-English-ebook/dp/B0CG842GPR) the book

### Please note that I'm not sponsored by the stores or the authors; I'm simply sharing my plans in a way that can be helpful to everyone, especially beginners. Enjoy! :)
